The source files are organized in modules under the “src/” folder. Each module is lodated at “src/<module name>”.

Module files define parts that are used to build the .aff and .dic files of the spellchecker (e.g. gl.aff and gl.dic).
The modular approach makes it possible to define extensions to the main spellchecker, with words and affixes that might
not be part of the standard Galician language and rules.


Module Files
============

Each module might contain any combination of the following files:


dependencies.txt

List of modules this module depends on, each one in a new line.


header.txt
